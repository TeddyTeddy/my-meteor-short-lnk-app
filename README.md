# my-meteor-short-lnk-app
This code is as a result of Lectures 50-63 of Meteor and React Course:
https://www.udemy.com/meteor-react/

As usual in the course, part of the source code is provided by the lecturer and part of it is done by me as exercises.
So you here see a code that is a mix of lecturer's code + my code.

The short-link web app is not complete in this repository just yet. Work in progress. 
I need to complete 36 more lectures and do the exercises in them to be able to complete the short link app.

Once I get there, the final version of the short-link web app will look like this
https://short-lnk.herokuapp.com/

Note that short-link web app uses react router.
